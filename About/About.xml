	<description>Vanilla Food Variety Expanded introduces a "Food Variety" need, adding a new layer of complexity to meal planning. This need keeps track of the range of meals and ingredients that each colonist consumes. A diverse diet enhances the "Food Variety" score, rewarding colonists with mood boosts for trying new and different foods. Conversely, a lack of variety in their diet leads to mood penalties, reflecting the monotony of eating the same meals repeatedly. All this is configurable!

Additionally, the mod introduces "favorite meals / ingredients" for each colonist. When a colonist consumes their favorite meal or an ingredient they love, it provides a special bonus to their Food Variety need, basically counting twice. A new item, recipe books, allows colonists to acquire a second favourite meal / ingredient.

With this mod you'll find yourself challenged not only to keep your colonists fed but to keep them happy and satisfied with a varied and enjoyable diet, enhancing your colony's storytelling. The best part? There are no downsides to experimenting with new foodsâ€”only opportunities for positive outcomes!</description>
